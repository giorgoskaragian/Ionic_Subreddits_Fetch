# Ionic_Subreddits_Fetch

This was made solely for the Omnixell internship application.

I had no experiece with Ionic, Angular ,TypeScript before making this so it essentially my second try playing with those.

----------What it is----------

It is an app that fetches posts from reddit API with category and feed-size selection. 
It surely aint the best paint app out there. :X

---------How to run---------

Preferably by running the subRedditsFetch.apk which is located in

C:\Users\George Kar\Desktop\Ionic_Subreddits_Fetch\Ionic_SubReddit_Fetch\platforms\android\build\outputs\apk

Notice: If you run it on the browser make sure you toggle the device toolbar.

This was made in a very small timeframe as i will send the application today.
