# Ionic_Subreddits_Fetch

This was made solely for the Omnixell internship application.

I had no experiece with Ionic, Angular ,TypeScript before making this so it essentially my second try playing with those.

----------What it is----------

It is an app that fetches posts from reddit API with category and feed-size selection. 
It surely aint the best paint app out there. :X

This was made in a very small timeframe as i will send the application today.
